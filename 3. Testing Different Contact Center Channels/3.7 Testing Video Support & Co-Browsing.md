# **3.7 Testing Video Support & Co-Browsing**

In an age of hyper-digital engagement, contact centers are rapidly transforming into high-tech service hubs that go well beyond voice and chat. One of the most powerful innovations in customer service is the integration of **video support** and **co-browsing** tools. These technologies provide a real-time, visual means of interaction, enhancing customer engagement, reducing issue resolution time, and boosting satisfaction.

But with power comes complexity. Testing video support and co-browsing systems in a contact center environment presents a unique set of challenges that extend far beyond traditional QA. You’re not just testing interfaces—you’re testing human-like interactions across devices, browsers, operating systems, networks, and compliance environments. This article provides a comprehensive guide to end-to-end testing of video and co-browsing solutions in contact centers, covering everything from infrastructure to UX, APIs, security, and beyond.

## **1. Understanding Video Support and Co-Browsing**

**Video Support** allows a customer and an agent to interact over a secure video call. This is often used for:

* Remote troubleshooting (e.g., technical support, installation guidance)
* Face-to-face customer service (e.g., banking, healthcare consultations)
* Visual identification and KYC (e.g., verifying identity with government-issued documents)

Video support significantly humanizes the support experience, especially for complex or emotionally sensitive issues. The visual presence of an agent adds empathy and trust to the customer experience.

**Co-Browsing**, short for collaborative browsing, enables an agent to view or interact with a customer’s browser in real time. It’s especially useful for:

* Guiding users through complex forms
* Providing product tours or demos
* Troubleshooting web-based applications

Unlike screen sharing, co-browsing allows selective visibility and control, helping maintain customer privacy while enabling support. Most co-browsing tools mask sensitive data fields and allow users to opt in with granular permissions.

Together, these tools represent the next evolution in contact center technology and require robust testing strategies for successful implementation.

## **2. Key Architecture and Components**

Testing starts with understanding the architecture. Video and co-browsing involve many moving parts:

* **Frontend interfaces** (agent dashboard, customer browser)
* **WebRTC framework** for real-time video/audio streaming
* **STUN/TURN servers** for firewall/NAT traversal
* **SDKs or APIs** from third-party vendors like Agora, Twilio, Vonage, Amazon Chime
* **Embedded scripts** or iFrames for co-browsing capabilities
* **Backend services** handling session control, authentication, routing
* **Data transmission layers** ensuring secure, encrypted flow of visual/audio data

Additionally, contact centers may include middleware layers for API orchestration and session tracking. Some architectures also support peer-to-peer or mesh networks for optimal call routing.

From a QA perspective, you must test interoperability between all layers. Failure in one layer (e.g., STUN server misconfigurations) can prevent video sessions from initiating altogether. Additionally, network firewalls, VPNs, and proxy configurations may impact video and co-browsing performance, making infrastructure testing essential.

Architectural mapping is crucial. Document all dependencies, third-party services, and internal systems involved. Simulate real-world usage scenarios to uncover configuration issues before going live.

## **3. Functional Testing Strategy**

Functional testing ensures that the video and co-browsing workflows work as expected:

* **Call Initiation and Termination**: Can calls be started and ended from both customer and agent sides?
* **Session Alerts**: Are agents notified when a customer initiates or drops a session?
* **Permissions**: Are users prompted to allow video/camera/mic access? Are error messages meaningful when permissions are denied?
* **Fallback Logic**: Does the system handle failure gracefully (e.g., fallback to chat if camera access fails)?
* **Agent Controls**: Can agents mute/unmute, enable/disable video, take screenshots, or request control during co-browsing?
* **Co-Browsing Restrictions**: Can agents be prevented from accessing sensitive fields (e.g., credit card inputs)?

Other tests should validate timeouts, session idle detection, and user-controlled termination. Ensure UI elements respond appropriately based on platform (mobile vs desktop). Test support for joining sessions via link, callback, or embedded chat.

Functional QA should also explore interrupted sessions, partial page loads during co-browsing, and retry logic on connection failure. These scenarios often slip past regression tests but are commonly encountered by end-users.

## **4. UI and UX Testing**

User experience is everything in real-time interactions.

* **UI Consistency**: Are video call buttons, session timers, and alerts consistent across all devices?
* **Accessibility**: Can visually impaired or hearing-impaired users effectively interact with video/co-browsing tools (e.g., via captions or screen reader support)?
* **Error Messaging**: Are the error messages intuitive and actionable when something fails (e.g., browser doesn’t support WebRTC)?
* **Multi-language Support**: Does the UI dynamically render based on locale or language preference?
* **On-screen Guidance**: Is it easy for users to start or cancel co-browsing? Are tooltips helpful?

Include tests for dark mode, branding consistency, and responsiveness across screen sizes. Simulate use by customers with visual, auditory, or mobility impairments to validate real-world accessibility.

Record sessions and analyze agent-customer interactions to detect interface confusion, delays, or frequent misclicks. Incorporate heatmaps or UX analytics to study behavior patterns.

Ensure agents can multitask across tabs or applications without losing control or connection to the video session. A seamless UI is essential for high productivity and customer satisfaction.

## **5. Network and Device Compatibility Testing**

Real-time streaming relies heavily on internet stability, latency, and client-side resources.

* **Bandwidth Simulation**: Test video quality and call stability under low, medium, and high bandwidth using tools like Clumsy or WANem.
* **Device Matrix**: Validate experience across Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, tablets.
* **Browser Matrix**: Ensure compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.
* **CPU and Memory Load**: Monitor device performance (e.g., CPU spikes) during sessions.
* **Connection Drop Tests**: Simulate mid-session Wi-Fi or network drops and observe reconnection behavior.

Also test corporate firewall scenarios, proxy/VPN traffic, and hotspot tethering. High packet loss and latency conditions should be tested for visual/auditory sync issues.

Use automated scripts to cycle through devices and browsers with varying configurations. Monitor real-time stats like frame rate, bitrate, and packet drop percentage to build performance baselines.

QA should also track behavior during browser auto-updates or OS version upgrades.

## **6. Integration Testing with Contact Center Systems**

Video and co-browsing aren’t standalone tools—they integrate into a broader contact center platform.

* **Agent Desktop**: Test if agent dashboards correctly embed or pop out video/co-browsing windows.
* **CRM Integration**: Validate if session metadata (duration, resolution, notes) is logged into Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.
* **Ticketing Sync**: Confirm that support tickets include conversation logs and attachments from co-browsing.
* **Scheduling Tools**: If appointments are scheduled, test calendar sync and reminder triggers.

Also validate screen pops based on CRM data, single sign-on (SSO) handshakes, and integration with CTI (Computer Telephony Integration). Ensure real-time data push between video session and case record.

Regression testing must cover cross-system triggers—e.g., video chat ends and survey link is auto-sent, or co-browsing ends and agent notes are archived.

QA should mimic agent workflows to detect breaks in data flow and inconsistencies between session logs and CRM records.

## **7. Security and Compliance Testing**

Given the visual and interactive nature of these sessions, data security is paramount.

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Validate encryption in transit and at rest.
* **Consent Mechanisms**: Are users explicitly asked before video or co-browsing begins?
* **Field Masking**: Are sensitive fields masked during co-browsing (e.g., CVV, SSN)?
* **Audit Trails**: Are session logs timestamped and securely stored?
* **Access Control**: Only authorized agents should have access to start or join sessions.
* **Compliance**: Test GDPR, HIPAA, PCI compliance flows where applicable.

Also check secure storage of session recordings, log retention policies, and session timeout controls. Security headers and CORS settings should be validated in browser consoles.

Penetration testing is essential for co-browsing scripts to prevent code injection or XSS attacks. Authentication tokens and access cookies should have limited scope and expiry.

Coordinate with infosec teams to run vulnerability scans and ensure industry best practices are followed.

## **8. Load and Stress Testing**

To ensure scalability:

* **Concurrent Sessions**: Simulate multiple sessions and observe load handling on servers and agent desktops.
* **Latency Monitoring**: Track jitter, frame drop, and delay in high-traffic scenarios.
* **Backend Resilience**: Ensure backend APIs don’t throttle or time out under load.

Test edge cases like agents handling back-to-back video calls with limited system resources. Test queuing logic when session volume exceeds agent availability.

Build synthetic traffic bots that simulate user behavior under stress. Monitor STUN/TURN server health under concurrent connections. Validate scaling auto-heal mechanisms on cloud infrastructure.

Ensure load tests cover session teardown, cleanup scripts, and log archival behaviors.

---

## **9. Test Automation Frameworks**

Automating video/co-browsing testing is tough due to real-time media, but not impossible.

* **Selenium/WebDriver**: Automate UI flows like launching sessions, permission prompts.
* **Appium**: For mobile device testing.
* **OpenCV/Image Comparison**: For verifying on-screen content in co-browsing.
* **WebRTC Stats API**: Automate collection of call quality metrics.

Also integrate automation into CI/CD pipelines. Use headless browsers to reduce resource use during builds.

Test automation should verify video codec fallback, media negotiation, and dynamic bandwidth adaptation logic. For co-browsing, test DOM element tracking, masked element detection, and click delegation flows.

Maintain test data for bot sessions and include visual regression tests for all UI elements.

## **10. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

Involve real agents and customers:

* **Pilot Testing**: Run sessions with selected users under real support conditions.
* **Feedback Collection**: Use surveys and heatmaps to identify pain points.
* **Session Playback**: Replay recordings to analyze behavior and UX gaps.

Segment users by demographics, device type, or support case type to cover a wide variety of scenarios.

Capture audio-video sync issues, agent responsiveness, and customer satisfaction metrics. UAT often reveals usability issues that aren’t caught during scripted tests.

Encourage open feedback from frontline support teams. They are best placed to spot efficiency blockers or experience gaps.

---

## **11. Best Practices and Recommendations**

* Always maintain a test matrix for OS-browser-bandwidth combinations.
* Automate repetitive UI and performance tests.
* Include visual validation in regression cycles.
* Partner with InfoSec early when rolling out video support.
* Document co-browsing session logs for compliance.
* Use dummy data in co-browsing demos—never live data in testing.
* Monitor backend logs and WebRTC dashboards proactively.

Adopt shift-left testing by integrating security and performance checks early in the development cycle. Use observability tools to monitor real-time health.

Standardize test data templates for video and co-browsing scenarios. Build a centralized dashboard to track metrics like session success rate, average duration, and failure reasons.

Ensure training for QA teams on WebRTC, networking concepts, and accessibility best practices.
