### 3.1 Testing Voice Call Systems (PSTN, VoIP)

---

In the realm of modern omnichannel contact centers, where chatbots, emails, and digital messaging often take the spotlight, **voice remains the bedrock** of real-time, high-value customer service. Despite the technological shift, studies consistently show that customers turn to **voice channels when issues are complex, emotional, or urgent**. Whether it’s a customer disputing a transaction, seeking medical assistance, or lodging a critical complaint, voice calls continue to be the **most sensitive and direct form of customer interaction**.

As such, testing voice call systems — particularly those operating over **PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)** and **VoIP (Voice over IP)** — is absolutely vital to ensure clear, reliable, and legally compliant interactions. This article explores **end-to-end voice system testing** with a detailed look at what needs to be validated, common pitfalls, tools, KPIs, and best practices.

### Why Voice Testing Still Matters

Voice systems are:

* **The channel of choice** for time-sensitive or emotionally charged customer issues.
* **Legally significant** in sectors such as banking, healthcare, and insurance.
* **Preferred by older adults and accessibility users** who may struggle with digital interfaces.
* **Necessary for accessibility compliance**, especially for visually impaired customers.

Failure to properly test voice systems can lead to:

* Poor audio quality (jitter, latency, dropped calls)
* Incorrect call routing (e.g., wrong queue or language menu)
* Broken IVR navigation
* CTI integration failures (e.g., screen pop errors)
* Violations of telecom regulations and customer privacy laws

### Understanding the Voice Technology Stack

To test voice systems effectively, QA professionals need a basic understanding of the ecosystem:

**1. PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network):**

* Traditional landline system
* Offers stable quality but limited scalability/flexibility

**2. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol):**

* Transmits voice over internet (e.g., SIP, RTP protocols)
* Depends heavily on bandwidth and network conditions

**3. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):**

* Handles call setup, modification, and teardown in VoIP

**4. Codecs:**

* Compress voice data for transmission
* Common codecs include G.711 (high quality), G.729 (low bandwidth), Opus (versatile)

**5. IVR and ACD:**

* IVR (Interactive Voice Response) collects input and routes calls
* ACD (Automatic Call Distribution) sends calls to agents based on logic

**6. CTI (Computer Telephony Integration):**

* Connects voice system to CRM or agent desktop for screen pops, call logs, etc.

### What Needs to Be Tested in Voice Systems

Let’s go deep into the most critical test areas:

#### 1. **Call Connectivity and Routing**

* Test incoming and outgoing calls from various locations (domestic/international)
* Validate DID/toll-free number availability
* Verify call routing logic: menu selection, skill-based routing, language preference
* Ensure no dead ends or loops in routing
* Check fallback rules when agents are unavailable (voicemail, callback, overflow)
* Validate round-robin and weighted distribution logic across agents
* Test call transfer to multiple departments and external numbers
* Assess CLI presentation for outbound calls (masking, compliance)

#### 2. **Call Quality (QoS and Voice Clarity)**

* **Mean Opinion Score (MOS):** Ensure audio clarity rates 4.0+ (on a scale of 1–5)
* **Latency:** Ensure two-way delay is <150 ms
* **Jitter:** Measure variation in delay (target <30 ms)
* **Packet Loss:** Ideally under 1%
* Validate codecs under different network conditions
* Use network emulation tools to test VoIP under simulated high-latency, low-bandwidth environments
* Perform speech-to-text validations (voicebots and IVRs)
* Conduct tests in noise-heavy environments (malls, airports) to assess resilience
* Check call quality on mobile data, home broadband, and VPN scenarios
* Validate dynamic codec negotiation for bandwidth adaptation

#### 3. **IVR Functionality Testing**

* Test DTMF (keypad) and voice input response accuracy
* Validate prompt timing, clarity, and language support
* Test nested menu navigation
* Ensure timeouts and fallback to agents work
* Confirm personalized prompts (based on caller ID, CRM profile)
* Verify that incorrect inputs are handled gracefully
* Assess IVR response to silent callers, hung-up sessions, or repeated inputs
* Test journey variations based on business hours, location, and previous interactions

#### 4. **Failover and Disaster Recovery**

* Simulate failure of SIP trunk or VoIP gateway and confirm call rerouting
* Validate geographic redundancy (multi-region cloud contact centers)
* Test high-availability (HA) configurations
* Check alerts and dashboards for real-time failover detection
* Perform DR drills: What happens during a power outage or internet drop?
* Simulate sudden agent unavailability and ensure call overflow to backup sites
* Test multiple circuit availability in legacy PSTN systems

#### 5. **Load and Performance Testing**

* Simulate peak-hour traffic (e.g., 1000 concurrent calls)
* Stress test IVR systems for concurrent input handling
* Load test call queues and ACD logic
* Validate auto-scaling in cloud-based contact centers (Amazon Connect, Genesys Cloud)
* Measure impact on CTI during mass logins/logouts
* Simulate flash events (marketing campaigns, payment deadlines)
* Assess delay in call setup and routing logic under extreme conditions

#### 6. **Agent Experience and CTI Testing**

* Test agent login/logout reliability
* Validate screen pop accuracy and load speed
* Test call controls: mute, transfer, hold, consult
* Confirm call notes and disposition updates post-call
* Validate real-time call monitoring and whisper coaching
* Simulate call transfer scenarios (warm, cold, consult)
* Test UI response during call bursts or when multiple CRM tabs are open
* Validate CRM linkage post-call (disposition, notes, outcome tagging)

#### 7. **Call Recording and Transcription**

* Confirm recordings start and end as per policy
* Ensure multiple recording formats are supported (e.g., MP3, WAV)
* Test metadata tagging (caller ID, call ID, timestamp)
* Validate storage encryption and retrieval mechanisms
* Verify compliance with call disclosure regulations ("this call may be recorded")
* Transcription accuracy for AI/NLP post-call analysis
* Check multi-party call recordings (conference, transfers)
* Ensure transcription redacts PII for compliance

#### 8. **Device and Channel Compatibility**

* Test calls from landlines, mobile (4G/5G), softphones, and WebRTC
* Verify platform behavior on Chrome, Edge, Safari
* Validate headset compatibility for agents (Plantronics, Jabra, etc.)
* Run voicebot tests across Android/iOS apps
* Ensure support for TTY (Text Telephone) or relay services for hearing-impaired users
* Test call pickup behavior on multiple devices (e.g., mobile + desktop agent setup)
* Validate audio quality across wired and Bluetooth connections

#### 9. **Geographic and Regulatory Testing**

* Validate local number formats and availability
* Ensure GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and telecom compliance
* Localize IVR flows and prompts
* Handle region-specific time-of-day restrictions and disclosures
* Test BPO call centers operating under different jurisdictional rules
* Confirm international toll and callback behavior
* Validate Do-Not-Call (DNC) compliance by geography

### Test Data & Environment Considerations

* Use non-production numbers or test DIDs
* Mask sensitive data in call recordings (PII, card numbers)
* Use audio simulators and pre-recorded test prompts
* Maintain network simulation tools to inject latency, jitter
* Separate environments for PSTN and SIP trunk testing
* Use real-time call dashboards to visualize flow
* Maintain a repository of IVR prompt versions per language
* Use synthetic users to test at scale without agent dependency

### Conclusion: Voice Is Still the Contact Center Crown Jewel

Despite the rise of digital channels, **voice remains unmatched in empathy, urgency, and resolution speed**. But its technical underpinnings are complex and fragile. A few milliseconds of jitter, a missed routing rule, or an unrecorded call can cause **brand and financial damage**.

Testing voice systems—especially across PSTN and VoIP—demands **technical rigor, network understanding, and business context awareness**. It’s not just about hearing someone; it’s about **ensuring a frictionless, high-fidelity conversation that builds trust**.

When your voice channel performs flawlessly, it’s not just your call center that wins—it’s your **entire customer experience strategy**.
